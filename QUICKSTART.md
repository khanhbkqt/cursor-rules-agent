# 🚀 Quick Start Guide
**Get started with Cursor Rules Agent in 5 minutes**

## 🎯 You've Successfully Installed Cursor Rules!

Your project now has enhanced AI workflow rules in `.cursor/rules/`. Here's what to do next:

## ⚡ Immediate Next Steps

### 1. **Open Cursor in this project**
```bash
cursor .
```

### 2. **Test the Agent** (Try any of these)
```
"What mode should I be in?"
```

The Agent will now intelligently detect which mode to operate in:
- **🧠 Brainstorming Mode**: For new ideas and research
- **📋 Planning Mode**: For breaking down features into tasks  
- **⚙️ Developing Mode**: For writing code and implementation
- **📚 Documenting Mode**: For updating docs and progress
- **🐞 Bug-Fixing Mode**: For critical issue resolution

## 🏗️ Optional: Initialize Project Structure

If you want the full workflow system with task management:

```
"initialize project structure"
```

This will create:
```
your-project/
├── .cursor/rules/          ✅ Already installed
├── docs/                   🆕 Documentation
│   ├── specs/              🆕 Technical specifications  
│   └── features/           🆕 Feature requirements
├── blueprints/             🆕 Architectural templates
└── task-index.json         🆕 Task management
```
