## 🎯 Introduction

**Cursor Rules Agent** is an AI-driven workflow system that transforms Cursor Agent into a true technical partner in software development. The system not only manages tasks but also **manages and links deep project knowledge** automatically and intelligently.

### Problems Solved

| Before | With Cursor Rules Agent |
|--------|------------------------|
| ❌ Users must write detailed tasks manually | ✅ AI automatically decomposes features into meaningful tasks |
| ❌ AI lacks business context | ✅ Direct linking of tasks with specification documents |
| ❌ Large context, token waste | ✅ Super-optimized context (lazy loading) |
| ❌ Rules loaded by guesswork | ✅ Deterministic logic identifies exactly 1 mode |
| ❌ Docs always out-of-sync | ✅ Docs auto-sync from task progress |

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### 4 Core Pillars

1. **Hierarchy & Knowledge Linking**
   - Blueprints: Architectural design templates for features
   - Task-index: Manages Feature → Tasks structure
   - Knowledge sources: Direct linking between tasks and detailed specs

2. **Deterministic Mode Detection**
   - Master Orchestrator identifies exactly 1 active mode
   - No more context confusion from multiple modes

3. **Context-Aware Loading**
   - Context Loader intelligently loads information based on mode
   - Highest priority for task's knowledge sources

4. **Task Granularity Principle**
   - Each task is a "Significant Unit of Work" (3-8 story points)
   - Clear testable outcomes

## ⚙️ System Requirements

- **Cursor IDE** latest version
- **Git** for version control
- File create/edit permissions in project directory
- Internet connection (for Cursor Agent)
- **MCP Tools** (optional but recommended for enhanced capabilities)

## 🚀 Installation Guide

### Quick Setup (5 minutes)

1. **Copy rules to your project**:
   ```bash
   # Create rules directory in project
   mkdir -p .cursor/rules/{core,modes,utilities,templates}
   
   # Copy all content from src/ to .cursor/rules/
   cp -r path/to/cursor-rules-agent/src/* .cursor/rules/
   ```

2. **Setup User Rules** (Personal Preferences):
   - Open Cursor Settings > Rules
   - Copy content from [`USER_RULES_TEMPLATE.md`](USER_RULES_TEMPLATE.md) to your User Rules
   - Customize communication style and preferences to your liking
   - These settings will apply to ALL your Cursor projects

3. **Bootstrap project structure**:
   Open Cursor and type:
   ```
   "bootstrap project structure"
   ```
   Agent will automatically create `docs/`, `features/`, `specs/`, and `task-index.json` structure.

4. **Test with first feature**:
   ```
   "Plan feature: User Authentication"
   ```

### Smart Setup (10 minutes) 🤖⭐

- **Auto-generate rules**: `"Generate rule for consistent API error responses"`
- **Self-optimize**: `"Analyze my code and suggest project-specific rules"`

## 🔄 Workflow Operations

### Knowledge-Aware Workflow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Planning as 🤖 Planning
    participant Spec as 📄 Spec
    participant Task as 📝 Task
    participant Coding as 🧑‍💻 Coding

    User->>Planning: "Plan feature X"
    Planning->>Spec: Scan specs/ for logic
    Planning->>Task: Create TASK_001<br>+ link to Spec
    User->>Coding: "Work on TASK_001"

```

### Detailed Workflow Steps

1. **Brainstorming** (Optional):
   ```
   "start brainstorming for new e-commerce features"
   ```
   - Collect and filter ideas using enhanced MCP tools
   - Create Idea Backlog with RICE analysis
   - Leverage web search and library research for inspiration

2. **Planning**:
   ```
   "Plan feature: Shopping Cart"
   ```
   - Create Blueprint if not exists
   - Decompose into meaningful tasks
   - Link with knowledge sources

3. **Developing**:
   ```
   "Start working on TASK_001"
   ```
   - Agent loads related specs
   - Code with the **RMWV + Surgical Edit** safety pattern to ensure precise and safe file modifications.
   - Real-time progress updates

   - Mark implemented ideas

## 🤖 Cursor Agent & Rules

### What is Cursor Agent?

[Cursor Agent](knowledge/cursor-agent.md) is the heart of Cursor's conversation experience - an AI assistant with capabilities:
- Understand → Plan → Act
- Read/write files, search codebase
- Look up docs, search web
- Execute terminal commands

### How do Cursor Rules work?

[Cursor Rules](knowledge/cursor-rules.md) teach the Agent project-specific rules through various types:

1. **Project Rules** (`.mdc` files):
   - Always Apply: `alwaysApply: true`
   - Auto Attached: `globs: ["src/**/*.ts"]`
   - Agent Requested: Based on `description`
   - Manual: Called with `@rule-name`

2. **Mode-specific Rules**:
   - Planning Mode → planning-agent.mdc
   - Developing Mode → developing-mode.mdc + safe-code-generation.mdc
   - Documenting Mode → documenting-mode.mdc

3. **Triggered Utilities**:
   - safe-code-generation: Enforces the **RMWV + Surgical Edit** pattern for safe code modifications, based on [Gemini 2.5 Pro best practices](https://forum.cursor.com/t/gemini-2-5-pro-06-05-has-issues-with-edit-reapply/101373/10).
   - enforcer: Blueprint gate enforcement
