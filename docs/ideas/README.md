# ðŸ’¡ Ideas Documentation

Simple organization for brainstorming documentation.

## Structure

```
docs/ideas/
â”œâ”€â”€ [feature-name]/          # One folder per feature
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.md      # User needs, stakeholder input
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ research.md          # Market trends, technology analysis  
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ analysis.md          # Risk assessment, prioritization
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ summary.md           # Final recommendations for Planning
â”œâ”€â”€ idea-backlog.md          # Central tracking of all ideas
â””â”€â”€ README.md                # This file
```

## Usage

1. **Create feature folder** when starting brainstorming
2. **Use the 4 core files** to organize research:
   - `requirements.md` - What users need
   - `research.md` - Market & tech research
   - `analysis.md` - Risk & priority analysis  
   - `summary.md` - Final recommendations
3. **Update idea-backlog.md** to track all features
4. **Hand off summary.md** to Planning mode

## Guidelines

- Keep files focused and actionable
- Include timestamps and sources
- Cross-reference between files when helpful
- Use MCP tools and document findings appropriately
