# ðŸŸ¢ Active Context Snapshot Template

The **Master Orchestrator** MUST generate this file as `docs/activeContext.md` **after every completed user request**. The goal is to provide a quick, machine-readable **and** human-friendly snapshot of the project's current working context so that future chat sessions can immediately resume from the right state.

## ðŸ”„ Update Rules
1. **Overwrite** â€“ Always regenerate the entire file; do not append.
2. **Single Source of Truth** â€“ Other agents/modes MUST read this file to seed context before mode detection.
3. **Reset** â€“ When project is reset/initialized, this file SHOULD be deleted and recreated by `Initializing` mode.
