- activeContext.md updates are now MANDATORY
- Commits must include context updates
- Violations will halt operations until remediated

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Fixed occasional context desynchronization issues
- Resolved missing commit scenarios
- Improved mode detection accuracy

## 📚 Documentation

- [Workflow Charts](/docs/workflow-charts.md) - Visual system architecture
- [KPI Metrics](/src/utilities/kpi-metrics.mdc) - Metrics documentation
- [Cross-Reference System](/src/utilities/cross-reference-system.mdc) - Integration guide

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

This release implements best practices from:
- Gemini 2.5 Pro enforcement patterns
- Industry-standard AI rule systems
- Community feedback on workflow compliance

## 📝 Migration Guide

No migration required. The system will automatically enforce new compliance rules on first use. Ensure your team is aware of the stricter enforcement:

1. activeContext.md must be kept current
2. All status changes require commits
3. Violations will halt operations
